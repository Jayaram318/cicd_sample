# My CI/CD App

This is a simple Node.js Express application used for practicing CI/CD pipelines.

**CI/CD Pipeline:**

This project uses GitLab CI/CD to automate the build, test, and deploy processes.

**To run the application locally:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

**To deploy to a containerized environment:**

1. Create a Docker Hub account.
2. Update the Docker Hub username and password in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
3. Push the code to the GitLab repository.
4. The GitLab CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the application.

**Note:**

- Replace `<your-docker-hub-username>` and `<your-docker-hub-password>` with your actual Docker Hub credentials.
- Add your actual test commands in the `test` stage of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
- Adjust the `deploy` stage to match your deployment target (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).

This is a basic example. You can extend it further by adding more complex features, such as:

- Code coverage analysis
- Integration with other tools like SonarQube for code quality checks
- Blue/green deployments
- Canary deployments

I hope this sample repository helps you learn and practice CI/CD concepts!
